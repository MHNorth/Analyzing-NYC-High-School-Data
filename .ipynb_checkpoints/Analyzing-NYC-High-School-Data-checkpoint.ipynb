    "In this data analysis project, our objective is to explore New York City's published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets.  New York City has a very large immigrant population that is extremely diverse.  Therefore, comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores can be a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair assessment of students' aptitude."
